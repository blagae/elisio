            <h3>Elisio Project</h3>
            <p>The Elisio project is an attempt to teach computers to scan Latin verses, and to share the results publicly with those who are interested.
            Scanning a Latin verse means, in this technical context, to analyze its structural variation of light and heavy syllables.
            <br/>
            With this scanning engine, we want to allow users to do batch scans of Latin verses,
            in hopes that they can eventually retrieve previously unknown information from this heavily stylized use of the Latin language.</p>
