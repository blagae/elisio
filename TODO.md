# TODO

This is a high-level list of tasks that are on the roadmap. There is no priority list as of this writing.

* testing
    * unit testing specific hexameter cases (to prevent regressions)
    * unit test pentameter algorithm
    * code coverage analysis

* essentially teach it Latin
    * investigate Whitaker's Words
        * declensions: be able to correlate avo with avos
        * conjugations: be able to correlate laborat with laboravit

* parsing
    * dramatic meters (this is probably a pipe dream, given its complexities)
